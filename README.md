Highway Joined Cars Detection

Overview
This project implements a computer vision solution for monitoring highway traffic in real-time. It utilizes state-of-the-art object detection techniques, particularly the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, to accurately detect and track vehicles entering the highway. The system is capable of identifying vehicles joining the highway and counting their numbers, providing valuable insights for traffic management, congestion control, and road safety enhancement.

Key Features
Object Detection: Utilizes YOLO model to detect vehicles in the video stream.
Object Tracking: Implements a custom object tracker to track vehicles over consecutive frames.
Event Detection: Identifies vehicles joining the highway and counts their numbers.
Visualization: Visualizes the detected vehicles and their trajectories on the video stream.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
OpenCV
pandas
ultralytics
cvzone
numpy
